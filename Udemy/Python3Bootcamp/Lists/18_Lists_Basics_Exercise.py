# Now that we've learned about lists, let's get some practice. See the problem statements in the
# comments below.

# Create a list called instructors
instructors = list()

# Add the following strings to the instructors list
    # "Colt"
    # "Blue"
    # "Lisa"
instructors.append("Colt")
instructors.append("Blue")
instructors.append("Lisa")

# OR

instructors.extend(["Colt","Blue","Lisa"])

# Run the tests to make sure you've done this correctly!
