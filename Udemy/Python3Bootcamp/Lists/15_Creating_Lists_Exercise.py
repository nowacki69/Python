# It's time to create your own lists. Define 2 separate lists:
# 1. First, define a list called my_stuff. It must be at least 4 elements long. The data is
#       completely up to you, but it must contain at least one string and one float.
# 2. Next, define a list called nums. It should be a list containing all the nubmers between
#       1 and 99 (including 99). Don't type this out manually! Use what we learned at the end of
#       the previous video!

# Define my_stuff here
my_stuff = ['booty', 69, 'fun', 72.3, 'Halos', True, None]

# Define nums
nums=list(range(1, 100))
