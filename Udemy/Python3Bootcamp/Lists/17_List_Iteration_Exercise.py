# I've given you a list called soundsself.
#   - Write code that loops over the list and adds all the strings together to form one large
#       combined string (don't add spaces between them)
#   - The combined string should be all in UPPERCASE as well
#   - Save the results in a variable called result

sounds = ["super", "cali", "fragil", "istic", "expi", "ali", "docious"]

# Define your code below:
result = "".join(sounds).upper()
print(string)
